two server calls will be made based on the token
1st will get the form
second will get the entitites to be reviewd.

For both requests put statis json files as data source under assets folder
create two services. One to fetch the form another to feth the entitites.
create home components thwt will take data from those services and render the form.

You need to create section, question and choice components, they need to be mapped to entities being reviewed.
